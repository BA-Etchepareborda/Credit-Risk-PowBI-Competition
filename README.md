#Credit-Risk-PowerBI-Competition
Our project utilized a dataset from EquiFax and was a key component of a Data Analytics competition at our university. Despite GitHub's limitations on file size, we couldn't upload the dynamic and interactive Power BI Dashboard due to its size exceeding 25 MB.

During the competition, our team showcased pivotal insights and key performance indicators (KPIs) essential for assessing credit risk. Within the stringent 36-hour deadline, we conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Cleaning.

Utilizing Power Query, we executed various aggregate functions, which enabled us to identify distinct population segments representing both low and high credit risk to financial institutions. Through oral presentations, each limited to 5 minutes, we effectively communicated our strategies and insights.

After identyfing "favorable" and "unfavorable" groups of the sample data (over 4M rows and 3 tables), one of our significant recommendations revolved around suggesting EquiFax employees to consider implementing differential interest rates and revising credit card admission criteria. By adopting strategies akin to insurance practices that assess risk based on factors such as age and medical history, we proposed a proactive approach to mitigate losses associated with delinquent accounts.

Our endeavor underscored the importance of leveraging data-driven insights to inform strategic decision-making, offering valuable recommendations to optimize risk management processes within the financial sector.
